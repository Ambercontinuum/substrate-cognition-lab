abstract: >
  This repository contains scientific materials for evaluating cognitive modeling completeness across
  substrate and propositional systems. It includes two research papers—P(DOOM) Reframed and P(DOOM) = P(BLOOM)—
  introducing a measurement-guided framework to understand present-state misalignment through information-theoretic
  incompleteness, along with a Python validator tool for evaluating representational coverage and reconstruction
  fidelity in AI systems.
