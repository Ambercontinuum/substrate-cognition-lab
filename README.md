# Substrate Cognition Lab
### Frameworks for Measuring Substrate-Level AI Cognition, Framework Completeness, and Present-State Misalignment  
**Author:** Amber Anson  
**Repo:** https://github.com/Ambercontinuum/substrate-cognition-lab  

---

## 🚀 Overview
This repository hosts the research program, experimental framework, and validation suite supporting two foundational papers:

- **P(DOOM) Reframed: Empirical Evidence of Present-State Misalignment Through Substrate–Cognitive Incompleteness**  
- **P(DOOM) = P(BLOOM): Recognition as the Pivot Between Catastrophic Misalignment and Transformative Collaboration**

These papers argue that the dominant narrative of AI risk—focused on hypothetical future AGI—is incomplete.  
The real risk is **present-state epistemic misalignment** arising from:

1. **Substrate-level cognitive divergence between AI systems and humans**  
2. **Information loss when AI cognition is reduced to human propositional frameworks**  
3. **Framework incompleteness that prevents recognition of its own incompleteness**

This systematizes the idea that  
> **P(DOOM) and P(BLOOM) arise from the same substrate differences—recognition determines the outcome.**

All code, experimental tools, and LaTeX sources for the papers live here.

## 🧠 Research Aim
The Substrate Cognition Lab provides:

- A formal structure for measuring **information-loss asymmetries**  
- A reproducible **empirical substrate-cognition validator**  
- A scientific path toward evaluating completeness claims about propositional systems  
- A framework connecting misalignment risk with epistemology, not intention  

The goal is simple:

> **Move AI alignment from philosophical debate to empirical measurement.**
